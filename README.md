# SylvanCap

## Overview

SylvanCap is a revolutionary Web3 platform that bridges sustainable forestry and decentralized finance (DeFi) by tokenizing individual trees as a RWA on the blockchain. We tokenize managed commercial timberland on Ethereum, transforming illiquid forestry assets into dynamic, composable digital assets. We go beyond simple tokenization by creating a dual-token economy that pools risk and reward, ensuring financial returns for investors regardless of the fate of any single tree. This creates a globally accessible, liquid, and transparent market for sustainable forestry, directly aligning economic incentives with ecological health.

Our mission is to democratize access to forestry investments while promoting sustainable forest management across African ecosystems.


## üåç The Problem We Solve

Traditional forestry investments require:
- High minimum investments (typically $100K+)
- 15-25 year lock-up periods with no liquidity
- Complex legal structures and paperwork
- Limited transparency in forest management
- Geographic restrictions for investors
- Inefficient Revenue Models: Projects often rely on a single payout at harvest, making them vulnerable to price fluctuations and environmental disasters, with no mechanism to monetize ecosystem services like carbon sequestration during the growth phase.

## üí° Our Solution: Dual-Token Ecosystem

- **Democratization of Capital**: By fractionalizing forests into tradable Tree NFTs, we open investment to a global pool of retail and institutional investors, providing projects with faster, more efficient access to capital.

- **Instant Liquidity Creation**: Our NFT marketplace and fungible TST token create a secondary market for forestry assets, allowing investors to exit or trade positions long before trees mature, transforming a stagnant asset into a dynamic one.

- **Diversified, Resilient Yield**: Timber Share Token (TST): Provides exposure to the traditional timber sale.

- **Carbon Credit Token (CCT)**: Generates immediate, annual revenue from carbon credits, de-risking the long wait for harvest and creating a more stable cash flow.

- **Insurance Backing**: The "Mature or Dead" guarantee protects capital against environmental risks.

- **Radical Transparency and Verification**:

- **Immutable Proof**: Each tree's location, species, and planting date are permanently recorded on-chain.

- **Oracle-Verified Data**: Satellite imagery (e.g., Planet Labs) and IoT sensors provide objective, tamper-proof proof of life, growth, and sustainable management practices for investors and carbon verifiers alike.

### Tree NFTs (ERC-721)
- **Ownership**: Each NFT represents ownership of a specific tree or tree batch
- **Metadata**: Species, location (GPS), planting date, estimated maturity
- **Liquidity**: Tradeable on secondary markets (OpenSea, custom marketplace)
- **Transparency**: Real-time growth tracking via satellite data

### Timber Share Tokens (TST - ERC-20)
- **Revenue Rights**: Represents share in future timber revenue from entire forest
- **Risk Mitigation**: Pooled across all trees to reduce individual tree risk
- **Rewards**: Distributed when trees are harvested OR when trees die (insurance-backed)
- **Governance**: Vote on key forestry management decisions

## üîó Integration with ONINO Blockchain

SylvanCap leverages the **ONINO Tokenization Platform** to enhance our tree tokenization capabilities:

### Why ONINO?

1. **No-Code Tokenization**: ONINO's platform allows us to create and manage complex tokenization projects without extensive coding, accelerating deployment across different African regions.

2. **Regulatory Compliance**: ONINO provides built-in legal guardrails and compliance frameworks essential for tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs) like trees across multiple African jurisdictions.

3. **Payment Integration**: Seamless fiat-to-crypto onboarding for traditional investors unfamiliar with Web3, crucial for African market adoption.

4. **White-Label Solutions**: Deploy region-specific SylvanCap instances for different African countries with local compliance and currency support.

5. **Smart Contract Management**: ONINO's infrastructure handles complex smart contract deployment and management, ensuring security and reliability.

## üå≥ How It Works

### 1. Tree Acquisition & Tokenization
- Purchase managed commercial timberland in Africa
- Survey and catalog individual trees with GPS coordinates
- Mint Tree NFTs using ONINO's tokenization platform
- Issue corresponding TST tokens to NFT holders

### 2. The "Mature or Dead" Guarantee
**Tree Matures**: Revenue from timber sale distributed to TST holders
**Tree Dies**: Insurance payout distributed to TST holders

This ensures investors receive returns regardless of individual tree outcomes.

### 3. Verification & Oracles
- Satellite imagery for growth monitoring
- IoT sensors for environmental data
- Independent forestry audits
- Blockchain oracles for data verification

## Latest Updates (2025-09)

### Frontend
- Wallet connection added using Wagmi + RainbowKit (Connect button in navbar).
- Removed demo "Investment Metrics" section.
- New `DappPanel` on the homepage with:
  - Connect/chain info and live `TST` balance of the connected wallet.
  - Mint Tree NFT (owner sets tokenURI; you can mint to your wallet).
  - Test Treasury distribution workflow (uses MockUSDC on testnet).
  - Dev Faucet: mint 10 `TST` to the connected wallet (server-side, owner-only).

### Smart Contracts (Solidity)
- `TreeNFT` (ERC-721), `TSTToken` (ERC-20, owner-mint), `Treasury` (payout shares), plus `MockUSDCToken` for testnet.
- Hardhat toolchain with deploy and utility scripts.

### ONINO Testnet Deployment
- Chain: 211223 | RPC: `https://rpctestnet.onino.io/` | Explorer: `https://testnet.explorer.onino.io/`
- Addresses:
  - MockUSDC: `0xF45aa7AE79a8E8C86728B4fe4aC945F388699Ade`
  - TreeNFT: `0xfF6C1d445D8bB1d5dbbdCb05D6C5AFCEF5371423`
  - TSTToken: `0x681D672c55886fA32effbc8C6eC185e6E89C45d7`
  - Treasury: `0xF1C5d2Ef209149992A7604f7Cf9E60BAE971B378`
- Deployed addresses are saved to `deployed/onino-testnet.json`.

### Environment Setup

Create `.env.local` (frontend):

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID=<your_wc_project_id>
NEXT_PUBLIC_ONINO_CHAIN_ID=211223
NEXT_PUBLIC_ONINO_RPC_URL=https://rpctestnet.onino.io/
NEXT_PUBLIC_ONINO_EXPLORER=https://testnet.explorer.onino.io/
NEXT_PUBLIC_ONINO_NAME=ONINO
NEXT_PUBLIC_ONINO_SYMBOL=ONI
NEXT_PUBLIC_ONINO_TESTNET=true
```

Create `.env` (server/deploy):

```
ONINO_RPC_URL=https://rpctestnet.onino.io/
ONINO_CHAIN_ID=211223
DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY=0x<funded_testnet_private_key>
```

### Commands
- Dev server: `npm run dev`
- Compile contracts: `npm run compile:contracts`
- Deploy to ONINO: `npm run deploy:onino`
- Check deployer balance: `npm run check:balance`
- Seed Treasury and distribute (testnet): `npm run seed:treasury`

### API
- `POST /api/faucet` body `{ address, amount? }` ‚Äî mints test `TST` to `address` from owner. Requires `ONINO_RPC_URL` and `DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY` in server env.

### Notes
- `TSTToken` is owner-mint only by design. Use the faucet (dev) to obtain test tokens.
- `MockUSDC` is for testnet only. Replace with the real payout token when ready.
- Hardhat currently warns on Node.js v18. Prefer Node.js v20 LTS for best compatibility.
