## Overview

SylvanCap is a revolutionary Web3 platform that bridges sustainable forestry and decentralized finance (DeFi) by tokenizing individual trees as NFTs on the blockchain. Our mission is to democratize access to forestry investments while promoting sustainable forest management across African ecosystems.

## üåç The Problem We Solve

Traditional forestry investments require:
- High minimum investments (typically $100K+)
- 15-25 year lock-up periods with no liquidity
- Complex legal structures and paperwork
- Limited transparency in forest management
- Geographic restrictions for investors

## üí° Our Solution: Dual-Token Ecosystem

### Tree NFTs (ERC-721)
- **Ownership**: Each NFT represents ownership of a specific tree or tree batch
- **Metadata**: Species, location (GPS), planting date, estimated maturity
- **Liquidity**: Tradeable on secondary markets (OpenSea, custom marketplace)
- **Transparency**: Real-time growth tracking via satellite data

### Timber Share Tokens (TST - ERC-20)
- **Revenue Rights**: Represents share in future timber revenue from entire forest
- **Risk Mitigation**: Pooled across all trees to reduce individual tree risk
- **Rewards**: Distributed when trees are harvested OR when trees die (insurance-backed)
- **Governance**: Vote on key forestry management decisions

## üîó Integration with ONINO Blockchain

SylvanCap leverages the **ONINO Tokenization Platform** to enhance our tree tokenization capabilities:

### Why ONINO?

1. **No-Code Tokenization**: ONINO's platform allows us to create and manage complex tokenization projects without extensive coding, accelerating deployment across different African regions.

2. **Regulatory Compliance**: ONINO provides built-in legal guardrails and compliance frameworks essential for tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs) like trees across multiple African jurisdictions.

3. **Payment Integration**: Seamless fiat-to-crypto onboarding for traditional investors unfamiliar with Web3, crucial for African market adoption.

4. **White-Label Solutions**: Deploy region-specific SylvanCap instances for different African countries with local compliance and currency support.

5. **Smart Contract Management**: ONINO's infrastructure handles complex smart contract deployment and management, ensuring security and reliability.

## üå≥ How It Works

### 1. Tree Acquisition & Tokenization
- Purchase managed commercial timberland in Africa
- Survey and catalog individual trees with GPS coordinates
- Mint Tree NFTs using ONINO's tokenization platform
- Issue corresponding TST tokens to NFT holders

### 2. The "Mature or Dead" Guarantee
**Tree Matures**: Revenue from timber sale distributed to TST holders
**Tree Dies**: Insurance payout distributed to TST holders

This ensures investors receive returns regardless of individual tree outcomes.

### 3. Verification & Oracles
- Satellite imagery for growth monitoring
- IoT sensors for environmental data
- Independent forestry audits
- Blockchain oracles for data verification
